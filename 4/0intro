NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            intro - introduction to file servers

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            This section describes programs that serve 9P (see intro
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            (5)), and can therefore be mounted, generating a new part of
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the name space. Some, such as dossrv, thereby make the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            contents of a foreign file format visible directly to
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Inferno applications\; others, such as acme, provide their
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            own services through operations on files in a name space.
