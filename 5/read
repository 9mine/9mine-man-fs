<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            size\[4\] Rread tag\[2\] count\[4\] data\[count\]

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The read request asks for count bytes of data from the file
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            identified by fid, which must be opened for reading,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            starting offset bytes after the beginning of the file. The
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            bytes are returned with the read reply message.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The count field in the reply indicates the number of bytes
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            returned. This may be less than the requested amount. If the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            offset field is greater than or equal to the number of bytes
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            in the file, a count of zero will be returned.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            For directories, read returns an integral number of
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            directory entries exactly as in stat (see <action name=stat(5)>stat(5)</action>), one for
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            each member of the directory. The read request message must
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            have offset equal to zero or the value of offset in the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            previous read on the directory, plus the number of bytes
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            returned in the previous read. In other words, seeking other
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            than to the beginning is illegal in a directory (see
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            <action name=sys-seek(2)>sys-seek(2)</action>).

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The write request asks that count bytes of data be recorded
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            in the file identified by fid, which must be opened for
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            writing, starting offset bytes after the beginning of the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            file. If the file is append-only, the data will be placed at
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the end of the file regardless of offset. Directories may
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            not be written.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The write reply records the number of bytes actually
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            written. It is usually an error if this is not the same as
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            requested.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Because 9P implementations may limit the size of individual
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            messages, more than one message may be produced by a single
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            read or write call. The iounit field returned by <action name=open(5)>open(5)</action>, if
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            non-zero, reports the maximum size that is guaranteed to be
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            transferred atomically.

ENTRY POINTS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Read and write messages are generated by the corresponding
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            calls in <action name=sys-read(2)>sys-read(2)</action>. Although <action name=sys-seek(2)>sys-seek(2)</action> affects the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            offset, it does not generate a message.
