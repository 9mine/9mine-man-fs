NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            clunk - forget about a fid

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            size\[4\] Tclunk tag\[2\] fid\[4\]
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            size\[4\] Rclunk tag\[2\]

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The clunk request informs the file server that the current
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            file represented by fid is no longer needed by the client.
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The actual file is not removed on the server unless the fid
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            had been opened with ORCLOSE.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Once a fid has been clunked, the same fid can be reused in a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            new walk or attach request.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Even if the clunk returns an error, the fid is no longer
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            valid.

ENTRY POINTS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            A clunk message is generated when a file descriptor is
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            closed (usually by the garbage collector) and indirectly by
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            other actions such as failed open calls.
