NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            grab - Confine pointer and keyboard events to a window
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            sub-tree

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            grab what ?arg arg ...?

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            This command implements simple pointer grabbing for Tk. When
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            a grab is set for a particular window, Tk restricts all
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            pointer events to the grab window and its descendants in
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Tk's window hierarchy. Whenever the pointer is within the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            grab window's subtree, the pointer will behave exactly the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            same as if there had been no grab at all and all events will
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            be reported in the normal fashion. When the pointer is
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            outside window's tree, button presses and releases and mouse
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            motion events are reported to window, and window entry and
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            window exit events are ignored. The grab subtree ``owns''
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the pointer: windows outside the grab subtree will be
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            visible on the screen but they will be insensitive until the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            grab is released. The tree of windows underneath the grab
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            window can include top-level windows, in which case all of
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            those top-level windows and their descendants will continue
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            to receive mouse events during the grab.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            A grab locks out all applications on the screen, so that
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            only the given subtree of the grabbing application will be
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            sensitive to pointer events (mouse button presses, mouse
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            button releases, pointer motions, window entries, and window
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            exits). During grabs the window manager will not receive
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            pointer events either (which means that if the grab is not
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            released the whole GUI will freeze, so be careful!).

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The grab command can take any of the following forms:

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            grab release window
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 Releases the grab on window if there is one, otherwise
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 does nothing.  Returns an empty string.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            grab set window
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 If a grab was already in effect for this application on
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 window's display then it is automatically released. If
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 there is already a grab on window then the command does
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 nothing.  Returns an empty string.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            grab ifunset window
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 Same as grab set except that window is only grabbed if
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 there is no other grab currently in effect.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            grab status window
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 Returns none if no grab is currently set on window, or
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 window if it has the grab.

BUGS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The current application-exclusive nature of grab is a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            problem which will be adressed in the future.
