<action name=DESTROY(9)>DESTROY(9)</action>                                             <action name=DESTROY(9)>DESTROY(9)</action>

NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            destroy - Destroy one or more windows

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            destroy ?window window ...?

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            This command deletes the windows given by the window
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            arguments, plus all of their descendants. The windows are
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            destroyed in order, and if an error occurs in destroying a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            window the command aborts without destroying the remaining
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            windows.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The Destroy event is fired for each window destroyed,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            including descendants.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            If the window ``.'' is specified, it is unmapped rather than
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            destroyed and the Destroy event is not fired on it. However,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            all of its decendants are destroyed as normal.
