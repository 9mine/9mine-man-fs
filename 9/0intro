NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            intro - introduction to Inferno Tk

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            This section of the manual provides a reference for the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Inferno Tk implementation, which is accessed by Limbo
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            programs via <action name=tk(2)>tk(2)</action>, and from <action name=sh(1)>sh(1)</action> via <action name=sh-tk(1)>sh-tk(1)</action>.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The following pages were derived by Vita Nuova from
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            documentation that is

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The format of the pages has changed to follow the format of
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the rest of this manual, but more important, the content has
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            been changed (typically in small ways) to reflect the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            variant of Tk implemented by Inferno.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>         Programming Interface
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The interface to Inferno Tk is exclusively through the <action name=tk(2)>tk(2)</action>
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            module\; all the Tk commands described in this section of the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            manual are excecuted by passing them as strings to the cmd
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            function in that module. The Inferno Tk implementation is
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            based on the Tk 4.0 documentation, but there are many
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            differences, probably the greatest of which is that there is
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            no associated Tcl implementation, so almost every Inferno
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            application using Tk will need to have some Limbo code
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            associated with it (the <action name=sh-tk(1)>sh-tk(1)</action> shell module can also
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            fulful this rôle). See ``An Overview of Limbo/Tk'' in Volume
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            2 for a tutorial-style introduction to the use of Inferno Tk
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            which summarises the differences from Tk 4.0.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>         Tk Commands
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The command string passed to tk->cmd may contain one or more
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Tk commands, separated by semicolons. A semicolon is not a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            command separator when it is nested in braces ({}) or
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            brackets (\[\]) or it is escaped by a backslash (\). Each
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            command is divided into words: sequences of characters
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            separated by one or more blanks and tabs.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            There is also a `super quote' convention: at any point in
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the command string a single quote mark (') means that the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            entire rest of the string should be treated as one word.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            A word beginning with an opening brace ({) continues until
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the balancing closing brace (}) is reached. The outer brace
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            characters are stripped. A backslash can be used to escape a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            brace in this context. Backslash characters not used to
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            escape braces are left unchanged.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            A word beginning with an opening bracket (\[) continues until
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the balancing closing bracket (\]) is reached. The enclosed
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            string is then evaluated as if it were a command string, and
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the resulting value is used as the contents of the word.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Single commands are executed in order until they are all
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            done or an error is encountered. By convention, an error is
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            signaled by a return value starting with an exclamation mark
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            (!). The return value from tk->cmd is the return value of
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the first error-producing command or else the return value
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            of the final single command.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            To execute a single command, the first word is examined. It
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            must either begin with dot (.) in which case it must name an
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            existing widget, which will interpret the rest of the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            command according to its type, or one of the following
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            words, each of which is documented in a manual page of that
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            name in this section:

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            bind         focus        lower        scrollbar
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            button       frame        menu         see

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>         Widget Options
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Each manual page in this section documents the options that
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            a particular command will accept. A number of options are
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            common to several of the widgets and are named as ``standard
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            options'' near the beginning of the manual page for each
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            widget. These options are documented in <action name=options(9)>options(9)</action>. The
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            types of value required as arguments to options within
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Inferno Tk are documented under <action name=types(9)>types(9)</action>.

BUGS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The bracket (\[\]) command interpretation is not applied
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            consistently throughout the Inferno Tk commands (notably,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the argument to the <action name=send(9)>send(9)</action> command will not interpret this
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            correctly). Moreover, if the string to be substituted is
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            significantly bigger than the command it was substituting,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            then it will be truncated.
