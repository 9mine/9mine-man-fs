DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The plap driver serves a three-level directory giving access
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            to the link level protocol used by an Edgeserver card to
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            communicate with other cards in a USR/3Com chassis. On first
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            attach (usually by a <action name=bind(1)>bind(1)</action> to /net) the driver opens a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            connection to the packet bus device #Y described in <action name=pbus(3)>pbus(3)</action>.
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            It multiplexes that connection using a specialised member of
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the LAP family of protocols.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The top level directory contains a single directory naming
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the protocol, plap. It contains a clone file and a set of
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            conversation directories numbered from 0 to 127\; only active
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            conversation directories are present.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Opening the clone file allocates a new conversation
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            directory n. The file descriptor will point to the control
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            file, ctl, of that directory. Reading the file returns a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            text string giving the conversation number.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Each conversation directory contains six files. The
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            connection is controlled by writing text strings to the ctl
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            file. Once a connection has been established, data is
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            exchanged with the remote peer by reading and writing the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            data file.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            A plap address has the form:

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 \[ slot. \] chan!sap

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            where slot is a chassis slot number, chan is a logical
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            channel (eg, a modem number), and sap is a number
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            representing a `service access point'.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The following control messages are supported:

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            connect remoteaddr \[ localaddr \] 
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 Make a connection to the given remote address (of the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 form given above). If a local address is not specified,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 the system will assign an unused address dynamically
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 (the local chassis slot number is of course fixed).
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 Connect fails if the connection is already announced or
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 connected, or localaddr is already in use.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            announceaddress
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 Set the local address to address and accept incoming
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 calls to that address. If no address is specified, all
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 incoming calls to addresses not explicitly announced
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 will be accepted by this connection. Announce fails if
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 the connection is already announced or connected, or
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 the local address specified is already in use.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The remote and local files contain the remote and local
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            addresses for the connection in the full address form slot.
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            chan!sap. The status file returns a line giving the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            directory name, number of active opens, and the state of the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            connection.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            A process listens for incoming calls by opening the listen
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            file using <action name=sys-open(2)>sys-open(2)</action>. The open will block until a call
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            arrives, when it will return a file descriptor open on the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            ctl file of the newly accepted connection, which can be read
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            to find the directory number and thus the other files.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The device follows the conventions that allow dial, announce
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            and listen of <action name=dial(2)>dial(2)</action> to do the work needed to establish and
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            manipulate network connections.
