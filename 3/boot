NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            boot - reboot under program control

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            bind -a #B /dev

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            /dev/boot
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            /dev/kexec
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            /dev/mem

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Boot serves a directory containing three files that control
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            a reboot of the system. The files can only be opened by the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            host owner (see eve(10.2)).

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Boot is a write-only file that accepts 4 bytes representing
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            a kernel address, high-order byte first. The system will
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            transfer control to that address, which is assumed to be the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            start of low-level reboot code. There is no return from the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            write on success or failure.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Kexec is a write-only file to which an uncompressed kernel
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            image can be written, a chunk at a time. When the file is
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            closed, the system will transfer control to the start of the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            image, which again is assumed to be low-level reboot code.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Mem copies data to and from kernel memory, taking the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            current file offset as an address therein.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Boot flushes caches as necessary to ensure that writes to
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            kernel memory through any of these files will be visible
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            when subsequently executed as instructions.

DIAGNOSTICS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Invalid addresses are diagnosed, but otherwise there is no
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            error return.
