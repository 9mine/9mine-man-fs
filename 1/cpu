NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            cpu - execute a remote command

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            cpu \[ -C alg \] \[net!\]host \[ command \[ arg... \] \]

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Cpu dials host (using network tcp if net is not given),
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            exports the local namespace and executes the given command
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            on that machine. The local namespace is visible to the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            command in /n/client\; local device files are bound into the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            remote device directory. If command is not given, then
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            /dis/sh is run.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The -C option sets the algorithm to be used following
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            authentication for digesting or encryption, to alg. See ssl
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            (3) for the supported algorithms. The default is none: ssl
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            (3) is not used after authentication.

BUGS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Although the draw device files are visible to the remote
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            command, the original implementation of Tk meant that
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            windowing applications could not receive events when run
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            remotely. That has been fixed in this release, but cpu has
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            not yet been updated to take advantage. A later update will
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            do that.
