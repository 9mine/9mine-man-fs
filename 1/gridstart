NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            gridstart, engridden - connect to a public 9p service grid

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            gridstart

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            engridden

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            gridstart is a startup script which connects to a set of
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            public 9p services. By default it launches a subrio with
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            several applications running. It can also make all
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            connections via tls if desired.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The script begins by dialing and mounting an Inferno
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            registry which lists the publicly available services. It
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            then processes the index file to create a series of commands
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            to dial and mount the services listed. The services are an
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            irc-like chat provided by hubfs, an acme-editable wiki which
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            can also be viewed (but not edited) via browser at
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            http://wiki.9gridchan.org, a publicly writable ramdisk, a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            read-only root fs, a shared plumber that can be used to send
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            messages between clients, and a separate publicly-writable
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            registry for users to share additional services. The wiki
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            has documentation on these services. The <action name=engridden(1)>engridden(1)</action> script
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            is used to mount all the services as per their respective
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            entries in the grid registry.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The script launches the <action name=hubchat(1)>hubchat(1)</action> client which connects to
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the default chat channel. It also starts <action name=acme(1)>acme(1)</action> with the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            wiki-editing command in a window, highlight the 'Wiki
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            /mnt/wiki' command and middle-click to start the acme wiki
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            viewing/editing program.

BUGS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            It took almost ten years to figure out how to make a useful
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            public 9p service grid.

META
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            "A simple task, connecting using a script, but still to

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            stopping to rest and eat. Running a script is simple, you
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            download the tools required and run the script. Both require
