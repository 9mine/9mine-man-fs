NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            ps - process (thread) status

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            bind '#p' /prog

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            ps

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Ps prints to the standard output information about all
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            current Inferno processes. It looks in /prog for process
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            status files\; normally that requires that the <action name=prog(3)>prog(3)</action> device
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            has previously been bound there (as shown above), but it is
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            also possible to import /prog from a remote machine.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Each line of information printed consists of seven columns:
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the process id, the process group id, the owner of the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            process, cpu time used by the process, the run state of the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            process, the amount of memory used by the process, and the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            name of the module containing the currently running
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            function.

BUGS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The amount reported as ``memory used'' does not accurately
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            reflect the amount of memory referred to by the process,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            because the heap is shared.
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The cpu time used is currently shown as zero in most hosted
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            implementations.
