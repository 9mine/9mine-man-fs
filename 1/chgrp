NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            chgrp - change file's group or owner

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            chgrp \[ -uo \] id file ...

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Chgrp changes the group ownership of each file to the given
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            id, if the file's server permits it. The -u and -o options
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            are equivalent and cause chgrp to change file ownership
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            instead, if the file's server permits it.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Normally, a file's group can be changed by the file's owner,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            if the owner is a member of the new group, or by the leader
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            of both the file's current group and the new group, but
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            various underlying devices, file servers and host operating
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            systems might not permit the operation at all. Group and
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            ownership changes allowed by a given device are documented
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            by the device's manual page. See <action name=sys-stat(2)>sys-stat(2)</action> for the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            variations amongst host operating systems.
