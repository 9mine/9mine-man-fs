NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            disdep - print load dependencies for Dis file

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            disdep \[ -a \] \[ -d \] \[ -o \] \[ -p \] \[ -s \] file ...

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Disdep reads each file, which must be a Dis object file, and
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            finds all unique strings in it that end in .dis. It takes
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            each such string as the name of a Dis file, and if the file
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            exists, it does the same for it, and so on, recursively. It
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            writes each unique name to the standard output. The result
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            is a list of all statically-named Dis files that might be
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            referenced by an application, typically as the operand of a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Limbo load operator. Several options change or extend the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            output:

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            -a   Print all names as they are encountered in the search,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 including duplicates.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            -d   Indent to show the dependency structure.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            -o   Show only the immediate (outermost) dependencies of
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 each file.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            -p   Print the dependency relation as pairs: a file, a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 space, and the name of a file on which it depends. Only
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 the the first name is printed when a file depends on no
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 other. This format is useful as input to mk(10.1)
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 dependency generators, or dependency graphing programs.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            -s   Include strings of the form "$\[A-Z\].*" on the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 assumption they are the names of system modules loaded
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>                 by the application.
