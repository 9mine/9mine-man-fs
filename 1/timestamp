<action name=TIMESTAMP(1)>TIMESTAMP(1)</action>                                         <action name=TIMESTAMP(1)>TIMESTAMP(1)</action>

NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            timestamp - log event times

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            timestamp \[ tag \]

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Timestamp reads lines from its standard input and writes
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            them to its standard output, prefixing each line with the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            time that it was written, in decimal milliseconds since
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            timestamp was started. If tag is given, it is written along
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            with the time stamp on each line, to enable tagging if
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            several writers are each writing to the same log file.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The first line written gives the time that timestamp was
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            started, in milliseconds since the epoch. Note that logging
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            events can cause timings to change, and that the timestamps
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            are only as accurate as the times reported by /dev/time.
