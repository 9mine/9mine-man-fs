NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            tsort - topological sort

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            tsort

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Tsort reads a set of partial order relations between labels
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            (sequences of non-space characters) from its standard input,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            and lists the labels on its standard output one per line
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            following a topological sort. Each input line represents a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            set of inequalities: the first label on the line is less
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            than all the others on the same line, and should appear
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            earlier in sorted order. (The relation might for instance
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            represent arcs in a directed graph, from the first label on
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            a line to the others, or dependency relationships.) Labels
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            on a line are separated by space or tab.

DIAGNOSTICS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            If the input contains cycles, tsort prints a diagnostic on
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            standard error for each cycle, listing its members. The
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            members of each cycle will also appear on the standard
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            output, in any order, but after any predecessors outside the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            cycle.
