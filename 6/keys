NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            keys - secrets shared with signer

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The file /keydb/keys exists only on a host acting as a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            `signer' (authentication server, Certifying Authority). It
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            holds a password entry for each user registered with an
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Inferno server. Each entry contains a user name, a password,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the time at which the entry expires, and the entry's status.
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The password is the secret shared between the user and
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            signer (authentication server), allowing the signer to sign
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            a certificate to authenticate a user's public key to others,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            using the secret to check the user's identity. The actual
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            secret is not stored, but rather its SHA-1 hash.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            The file is encrypted with a secret provided by the signer's
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            administrator\; normally that secret is entered once when
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            authentication services are started by svc/auth on the host
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            acting as signer (see <action name=svc(8)>svc(8)</action>). The file should also be
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            readable and writable only by the user identity that runs
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the signing service (ie, mode 600, see <action name=chmod(1)>chmod(1)</action>). Entries
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            are usually accessed only through the name space provided by
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            <action name=keyfs(4)>keyfs(4)</action>, which decrypts the file into internal data
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            structures given the administrative key, and makes each
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            entry visible as a separate directory. Using that name
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            space, entries are added and updated by an administrator
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            using <action name=changelogin(8)>changelogin(8)</action>, a user can change a secret using
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            <action name=passwd(1)>passwd(1)</action> via <action name=keysrv(4)>keysrv(4)</action>, and it is accessed for signing by
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            <action name=logind(8)>logind(8)</action> to obtain the secret used to verify the identity
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            of a client requesting a certificate (typically via
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            <action name=security-login(2)>security-login(2)</action>).
