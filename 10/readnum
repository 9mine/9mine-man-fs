READNUM(10.2)                                       READNUM(10.2)

NAME
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            readnum, readstr - return values from read from device

SYNOPSIS
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            int readstr(ulong off, char *buf, ulong n, char *str)

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            int readnum(ulong off, char *buf, ulong n, ulong val, int
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            size)

DESCRIPTION
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Readstr and readnum simplify the return of strings and
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            numbers from device read routines, because they deal with
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            any buffering and boundary cases. Several parameters to the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            read call are often handed on directly to these functions:
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            the file offset, as off\; the address of the user's buffer,
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            as buf\; and the number of bytes requested, as n. Both
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            functions return the number of bytes they have stored in buf
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            , and which can often be returned directly from the device
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            read routine.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Readstr satisfies a read by copying data into buf from the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            NUL-terminated string in str. The data transferred is
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            selected and limited by off, n and the length of str.

<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            Readnum converts the unsigned integer val to a decimal
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            representation in buf. The value is right-justified in a
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            field of size-1 places and is followed by a blank. Size can
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            be the global constant ``NUMSIZE'' for 32-bit integers\; the
<style color=#00ffffff size=1>.</style>            largest size allowed is 64 bytes.
